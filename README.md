## Overview
This project involves building a model to classify product items based on Google catalog categories and analyze sales data and purchasing patterns using market basket association rules. The workflow included data cleaning, model training with text vectorization and classification techniques, and a results dashboard to showcase insights.

## Methods and Statistics

### Data Cleaning
- Product items were categorized using Google catalog merchant values (data sourced from [Google Merchant Support](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324436?sjid=11384066497760467600-EU)).
- Products with duplicates were removed becasue we assumen that each product belongs to one category, this could affect prediction of trained model
- A rule-based filtering system was suggested to adjust misclassified items. An example Python function for correcting categories is provided:

    ```python
    def correct_categories(row):
        if 'Sony PS5 PlayStation 5' in row['item_name'] or 'Microsoft Xbox Series X' in row['item_name']:
            return 'Electronics > Video Game Consoles'
        return row['category']
    ```
- **Text Nomalisation** Text data was preprocessed removing whitespace, lowercases, stop words and non-alphanumeric characters

### Model Training, Pipeline and Evaluation
1. **Vectorization**: Text data was converted to numerical vectors using `TF-IDF` (TfidfVectorizer), capturing term importance across the product catalog.
2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Due to the dataset's size (>100,000 rows), a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was chosen for optimal performance and computational efficiency in high-dimensional text data.
3. **GridSearchCV** : Hyper parameter tuning using gridsearch was used to find the best optimal model
4.  **Evaluation** Macaro and Micro Averages of F1-SCORE, Precision and Recall was calculated to better understand the modelâ€™s performance with unbalanced data

### Market Basket Analysis
Market basket association rule analysis identified frequently purchased items, quantified by:
- **Support**: Probability of an item set's occurrence out of total transactions.
- **Confidence**: Probability of both items occurring together if one item is already present.
- **Lift**: Strength of the association between items; values greater than 1 indicate a stronger relationship.

Due to computational constraints, support, confidence, and lift metrics were manually calculated.

## Results
An interactive dashboard was deployed to visualize sales trends, insights, and business recommendations. Access it [here](https://farisayi-dakwa.shinyapps.io/Thanksgiving_week_sales/).
